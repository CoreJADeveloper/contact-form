A simple contact form builder developed with Angular and Angular material design. Check it!

== Description ==

Want to get the flavour of Angular and Angular material design within WordPress? Please try "Angular Contact Form Builder" for at least one time.

Admin portal of the plugin is fully developed with Angular and Angular Material Design. So within WordPress you get a different look and feel. Even there should have no JavaScript or CSS conflict with existing one. I used WordPress rest API to handle custom post creation and customization.

"Angular Contact Form Builder" is one of my fun project, I have worked ever! This is an  application based plugin where I used some latest JavaScript packages to integrate Angular and Angular material design. Even in front end there is no single line of jQuery code.

Enjoy!

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Angular Contact Form Builder, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Angular Contact Form Builder” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our contact form builder plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our contact form builder plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I create my first contact form? =

After installation of the plugin, in admin panel you see a new menu named ngContact Forms. Click/hover on the menu. You see a sub-menu page named Add Form. Click on the sub-menu page.

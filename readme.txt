A simple contact form builder developed with Angular and Angular material design. Check it!

== Description ==

Want to get the flavour of Angular and Angular material design within WordPress? Please try "Advanced Angular Contact Form" for at least one time.

Admin portal of the plugin is fully developed with Angular and Angular Material Design. So within WordPress you get a different look and feel. Even there should have no JavaScript or CSS conflict with existing one. I used WordPress rest API to handle custom post creation and customization.

"Advanced Angular Contact Form" is one of my fun project, I have worked ever! This is an  application based plugin where I used some latest JavaScript packages to integrate Angular and Angular material design. Even in front end there is no single line of jQuery code.

Enjoy!
